# bioparse

**NOTE: Don't use this yet!**

This is a collection of parsers built on modern tooling (parsers, trifecta,
lens) for dealing with biological sequencing formats such as FASTA, FastQ, and
phd.

The purpose of this library is NOT because of any problems I have found with
pre-existing libraries, but rather I am using it as a chance to become familiar
with the very basics of bioinformatics.

Because of that, you probably don't want to use this library, and should, at least
for now, use pre-existing libraries such as biofasta.
